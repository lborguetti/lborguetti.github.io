Hi! Thanks for spend your time reading my blog.

My name is Luciano, I working with Unix-like operating system a long time ago. Make and run your kernel was very funny. I like the approach of solving complex problems with simple solutions, and want to write about it.

My hobby is endurance sports, and love running without shoes (barefoot).
